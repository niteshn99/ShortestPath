# ShortestPath
Dijkstra algorithm implementation in java springboot to find shortest path in graph network

# Problem Statement
Consider a graph network of interstellar transport system used by Earth’s inhabitants in the year 2145. They require you to build a system that will allow them to find the shortest path from point “A”, being Earth, through the galaxy to any of the planets represented by the other nodes. You are provided with a list of node names and their respective distances between their linked planets.  In addition, you need to ensure that the system will work from any source to destination coordinates specified.
